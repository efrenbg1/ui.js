# ui.js
Simple and fast library for SPA (vanilla JS)

## Supports
 - PopStateEvent
 - Navbars
 - Interconnection between modules
 - Save and create status for modules
 - Reconstruct the site based on the URL
 - Async calls for DOM dependent stuff
 - Transition animations
 - Lists (including current page and orders)
 - Anything else that can be implemented via the constructor method's functions

## Implementation
Publicly is only in use in [efrenbg1/rmote.app](https://github.com/efrenbg1/rmote.app) with a rudimentary and old version. In the future I plan to include more complex examples.
